Rule: Validate that the _rewardProportion parameter stays within the safe range (0 to 1e18, representing 0%-100%).

What to Look For:

Input Validation: Check that the function explicitly rejects any _rewardProportion value greater than 1e18.

Edge Case Testing: Verify that the system behaves correctly when _rewardProportion is set to its maximum (1e18) and that it cannot be set higher to “erase” debt inadvertently.
