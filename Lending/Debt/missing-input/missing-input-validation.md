# EXPLANATION

Role of _rewardProportion: It determines the fraction of TAU tokens that are withheld to cover bad debt.
Flaw: There’s no check on its value, so a keeper can choose an absurdly high value.
An attacker (the keeper) can essentially “erase” all debt, undermining the value of TAU and risking the stability of the entire system.
Solution: Add a simple validation to ensure _rewardProportion is within the allowed range (0 to 1e18).

# What Does the Function Do?

keeper"—helps manage loans. The keeper’s job is to swap one kind of token (yield tokens) for another (TAU tokens) when liquidating loans. Part of the TAU tokens returned are then used in the system to cover bad debt, and the rest are given as rewards.

The function takes a parameter called _rewardProportion. This value is meant to be a number between 0 and 1e18 (which represents 0% to 100%). It tells the system what portion of the TAU tokens should be withheld (i.e., not distributed to users) to cover the debt. However, the function does not check whether the value provided is within this safe range.

# Why Is This a Big Deal?

Scenario: Suppose after a token swap, the function returns 1,000 TAU.
Intended Use: If _rewardProportion is 1e18 (100%), then the system calculates withheld TAU as:
(1,000 TAU * 1e18) / 1e18 = 1,000 TAU.
Exploited Case:
If the keeper sets _rewardProportion to 2e18 (200%), the calculation becomes:
(1,000 TAU * 2e18) / 1e18 = 2,000 TAU.
Here, the system would try to withhold 2,000 TAU—even though only 1,000 TAU was returned. This means more TAU is “released” (or accounted for) than actually exists, effectively wiping out the debt improperly. As a result, users might be able to withdraw their collateral without actually repaying any debt, which can destabilize the system.

# Key Fix:

The function should check that the _rewardProportion value is not greater than 1e18. This ensures that the keeper can only set a value between 0% and 100%

```solidity 

if (_rewardProportion > Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION) {
    revert invalidRewardProportion();
}
```
