# Check for Open Position Verification:

What to Look For:
Verify that the function includes a check to ensure no open positions exist before disabling the market.

```solidity
require(openPositions == 0, "Cannot disable market with open positions");

```
# Red Flag:
If the code does not perform this check, it allows the market to be disabled even when positions are open.

# Consistency Check Across Related Functions:
Compare this market status function with other functions that change system states. Ensure that all state-changing functions enforce similar safety checks regarding open positions.

# Simulate System States:

Test Different Scenarios:
Create test cases where a market has active positions and then attempt to disable it.
Observe Behavior:
If the market is disabled despite having open positions, itâ€™s a clear vulnerability.
