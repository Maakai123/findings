# Pool Isolation Check

What to Look For:
Verify that when refinancing a loan, the contract checks whether the new pool is different from the original (old) pool.
# Red Flag:
If the code does not require that newPoolId != oldPoolId (or an equivalent check), then a borrower may refinance back into the same pool, potentially canceling an auction.


# Auction Cancellation Mechanism

What to Look For:
Identify any lines of code that reset or cancel an auction. For example, setting:

```solidity
loans[loanId].auctionStartTimestamp = type(uint256).max;
```
# Red Flag:
If such a reset is done without restricting the action to certain conditions or roles, it could let borrowers cancel auctions to avoid liquidation.

# Financial Impact on Pool Balances

What to Look For:
Check how the function adjusts pool balances and outstanding loan amounts.
Red Flag:
If refinancing back into the same pool causes the pool to lose funds (for example, due to protocol fees) or increases risk exposure without proper checks, this indicates a potential exploit.
# Caller Authorization and Loan Validation

What to Look For:
Confirm that only the rightful borrower can call the refinancing function and that all loan parameters are properly validated.
Red Flag:
Even if the borrower is correctly authorized, allowing them to self-refinance into the same pool to cancel auctions may harm lender recovery opportunities.
